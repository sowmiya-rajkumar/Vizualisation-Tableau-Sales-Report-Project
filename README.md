# Sales Report Using Tableau

This project was part of my academic coursework on Data Visualization.

Leveraging Tableau, sales and profit trends were investigated to gain insights from a dataset downloaded from data.world and contains sales data for a company across various US regions that sells to large companies, distributors, and wholesalers.

To explore sales and profit trends from 2018 to 2020, this project utilizes a compelling array of visualizations, including maps, bar charts, quadrant charts, text tables, and dual-axis charts. The findings are then presented in a comprehensive dashboard and a narrative that unveils key trends.
